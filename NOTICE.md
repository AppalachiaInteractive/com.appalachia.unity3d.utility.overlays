# Additional Licensing Information
This repository is a fork.  The original repository can be viewed view following the fork information on Github.

As such, it is a more complex licensing situation than normal.  The licenses defined in this repository are intended to only claim the copyrights defined in `LICENSE.md`, and only to the extent that the licensing in the forked repository allows.  In the event of a discrepancy, the original repository's license must be honored first and foremost.

That is the intention of Appalachia Interactive, and it must be the intention of consumers of this library.  Using this library is an implicit agreement of such.

## License holders
